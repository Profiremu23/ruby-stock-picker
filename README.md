# ruby-stock-picker
My third Ruby project for the Odin Project (TOP). Imagine you had an hypothetical array of stock values and you wanted to get the purchasing and selling day in a split second, even if you know the values even up to a thousand days later? With Ruby, I write a program which can answer your question in a split second! The stock array is a program that takes an array of various values, and it returns the best days to buy and sell a stock with the highest profit margin. I have carefully coded the software so it doesn't return impossible results.

## How to Run It?
To run the downloaded program, open your terminal console in Linux/Git and navigate to ../ruby-stock-picker, then enter ruby stock-picker.rb in the console (make sure Ruby is installed for your console!).

## Editing The Stock Array
If you wish your stock_array to be longer (even with thousands of given values) or run multiple arrays, edit the line stock_picker([insert your values here]) or add another line with stock_picker and have fun with your new array!
